implementation of std::set based upon cartesian tree.

template<class ValueType> class Set; 

supports:
1. default constructor
2. constructor with 2 iterators: 
  iterator to the first element of the sequence and to one over the last element of the sequence, 
  iterators have ValueType type
3. constructro with std::initializer_list
4. copy constructor
5. operator=
6. destructor
7. size method
8. empty method
9. insert method
10. erase method
11. find method
12. lower_bound method
13. read only iterator, which supports:
  ++, --, ==, !=, ->, *, traverses container in increasing order (defined by operator< of ValueType)
