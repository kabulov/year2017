dynamic graph connectivity - online version:

given an empty graph and the amount of vertices in it (up to 300 000), following operations are performed (up to 300 000 operations):
- add an undirected edge
- remove existing edge
- print amount of connected components of the graph

directories:
- OneFileVersion : all code in one file which can be compiled and run
- TestableVersion : the code is separated into several files and also contains testing 

Runtime Analysis (n - amount of vertices):
- is-connected: O(logn) worst
- insertion: O((logn)^2) amortized
- deletion: O((logn)^2) amortized
