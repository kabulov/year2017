given two trees, find out whether they are isomorphic.

input:
1. n - amount of vertices in trees
2. n-1 pairs of integers (from 1 to n) - edges of first tree
3. same for second tree.

output:
if trees are isomorphic: n numbers - number n_i at position i is a correspondence between vertices i and n_i of first and second tree.
if trees are not isomorphic: print -1

(version with just yes or no)

runtime analysis:
O(nlogn) - n is the amount of vertices
