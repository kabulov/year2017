given cube of size n (n <= 128). queries follow (up to 1e5 queries):
1. increase value at cell (i, j, k) by v. (0 <= i, j, k < n), (-20000 <= v <= 20000)
2. find sum in parallelepiped given with 2 opposite endpoints : 
  (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)
  0 <= x1 <= x2 < n
  0 <= y1 <= y2 < n
  0 <= z1 <= z2 < n
  
  
3d fenwick tree is implemented.

space : O(n^3).
time : O((logn)^3) for update 1 and 2 queries.
