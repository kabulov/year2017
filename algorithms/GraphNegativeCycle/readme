Given graph. Find minimal number of the node which is in the cycle with negative sum of edge weights.

input:
n - amount of nodes (1 <= n <= 1000), enumerated 1..n
m - amount of edges (1 <= m <= 10000)
m lines with numbers a, b, c in each:
a, b - edge (1 <= a,b <= n)
c - weight (1 <= c <= n)

solution:
1. find strongly connected components (use topological sort for that, use dfs for topo sort)
2. remove edges which are not in strongly connected components
3. use for-bellman algorithm:
   relax n - 1 times all edges
   then relax all edges once more: 
     if edge relaxed then strongly connected component containing this edge is all negative cycle.
   
space and time linear : O(n + m)
