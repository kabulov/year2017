clean and neat code.

given n (n <= 1e5) integer values (up to 2^31 - 1) find subset with following constraints:
1. sum of 2 least is not less than max elem of the subset
2. sum of elements is maximum among all subsets satisfying 1

worst case constraints:
time: 0.5 sec
memory: 64 mb

solution provided here works in O(nlogn) time and O(n) space.
