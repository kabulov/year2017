doubly linked list with iterators and all other stuff.

implementation details:
uses sentinel in the end of list which also serves as end().
list right pointer of sentinel is first element of list and left of first is sentinel, 
thus list is cycled and no need in many ifs.

sentinel has a base class with only left and right pointers.
otherwise it would be sometimes impossible to default construct such object 
(if template parameter has no default constructor).
