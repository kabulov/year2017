lets make our own TensorFlow

inspired by : https://www.tensorflow.org/

consider input as a database table with rows and columns and perform operations on rows (implemented as a list of dict objects):

- map: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)
- reduce: https://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/reduce.html (takes sorted input)
- sort: sort rows by set of keys (columns)
- join: join two tables (just like in sql)
- fold: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)

organize computations using these basic operations.

problems to solve:
1. count frequence of each word in a series of documents
2. for each article find 3 most relevant words - tf-idf statistics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)
3. for each word find 10 most relevant articles - pointwise mutual information (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information)
